# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

## Overview

In this assignment, I applied my Python skills to analyze financial and election data using scripts I developed.

## Getting Started

To begin, I followed these steps to set up my project:

1. **Created a new repository** named `python-challenge` specifically for this assignment. Ensured this project was separate from any existing repositories.

2. **Cloned the repository** to my local machine to start working on the challenges.

3. **Organized My Project Structure**:
   - Created two main folders inside my local repository:
     - `PyBank` for the financial analysis task.
     - `PyPoll` for the election analysis task.
   - Each folder includes:
     - `main.py`: This script executes the analysis for each respective challenge.
     - `Resources/`: CSV files stored (`budget_data.csv` for PyBank, `election_data.csv` for PyPoll) in this folder.
     - `analysis/`: Saved the analysis results as text files in this folder.

4. **Pushed My Changes**: Uploaded my project files to GitHub to keep track of my progress and submit my work.
